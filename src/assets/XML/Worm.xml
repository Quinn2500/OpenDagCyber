            <question TEXT="A computer worm is a standalone malware program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. Often, it uses a computer network to spread itself. Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth. Any extra code added to the worm is typically referred to as the “payload”. Typical malicious payloads might delete files on a host system or extract data such as confidential documents or passwords. Probably the most common payload for worms is to install a “backdoor”. This allows the computer to be remotely controlled by the worm’s author as a “zombie”."/>

            <question TEXT="The worm spreads. Assessing damage is done when the malware has been contained and under control. This is done to determine if some data is stolen or deleted, or if there is physical damage to one of your systems. If you start doing this before, you risk more systems to get infected. 
            You now have 3 server infected by the worm. The worm has taken control of most of your systems on the network."/>
